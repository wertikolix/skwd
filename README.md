# Skwd - A skewed (Quick)shell

> **Fork note (wertikolix/skwd):** this fork adds a bunch of new bar widgets while keeping the original skewed parallelogram look:
> workspaces (with skewed chips, click/scroll to switch), system tray, keyboard layout (click/scroll to switch), network speed,
> focused window title and disk usage. The clock gained optional date + seconds, and the volume widget now supports scroll-to-change
> and middle-click mute. All of it is toggleable from Skwd-settings (Bar section).

## What is Skwd?

Skwd is my personal shell that also happens to have a group of platform-agnostic aesthetics-first desktop widgets (desktop shell), of which all have parallellogram designs (and many more, if you aren't into the whole skewed thing). Also works flawlessly with my wallpaper manager [Skwd-wall](https://www.github.com/liixini/skwd-wall).

Skwd works heavily with conditional display logic. That means that you control when things are and aren't shown, e.g. why show a music player if there's no music playing? Why take bar space with a sound widget unless you aim to change the volume or outputs? Skwd supports this sort of thinking out of the box.

And what programs you ask? Window switcher, launcher, music player, notification daemon, bar (with a whole slew of widgets) and power menu. There's also a settings widget for Skwd but well - who's counting. Only want to use some of them? No problem - Skwd is built to only run what you've selected by design and you waste no resources except some disk space having them all installed.

## The long story - Personal motivation and development practices

I develop Skwd because first and foremost it is my hobby but also because I was frustrated with the options on the market - there's many amazing desktop shells out there, many of which I have taken ideas from, but they always seem to fall flat on their promise of minimalism - how can something claim to be minimal and not even support simple use cases like "maybe don't show 10 workspaces if only 1 is actually in use"?

Note that **I use AI tooling** in my development just like I do in my professional life, however most of the code is mine including the quizzical design decisions.

## Skwd is still under heavy development

Developing Skwd is my hobby and I continuously refine and develop functionality for Skwd. There's many things I want to do like calendar integration with external calendars like Outlook and Gmail, but also lockscreens with facial recognition, custom grub themes, custom login screens... you name it.

So development is never really over, but at its core Skwd is really stable - this is after all the software I use every single day.

## Performance
Performance is a big consideration for Skwd. CPU-wise Skwd has options that aren't as nice to your CPU, and options that definitely are - up to you what you use.

For memory Skwd has a memory floor of about 210 MB whereas about ~20 MB of that is the Rust backend Skwd-daemon, but can routinely use up to ~400 MB depending on exactly what you're up to.

## Install

### Compositor-specific examples on how to launch

Skwd is driven entirely by `skwd <subcommand>` calls to `skwd-daemon`, so binding things in your compositor is just binding shell commands. Run `skwd help` for the full list of commands.

<Details>
<Summary>Niri</Summary>

#### Niri (`~/.config/niri/config.kdl`)

```kdl
spawn-at-startup "skwd-daemon"
spawn-at-startup "sh" "-c" "skwd bar toggle"

binds {
    Mod+Space        { spawn "skwd" "launcher" "toggle"; }
    Mod+B            { spawn "skwd" "bar" "toggle"; }
    Mod+Comma        { spawn "skwd" "settings" "toggle"; }
    Mod+Escape       { spawn "skwd" "power" "toggle"; }

    Alt+Tab          { spawn "skwd" "switch" "open"; }
    Alt+Shift+Tab    { spawn "skwd" "switch" "prev"; }
    Alt+Return       { spawn "skwd" "switch" "confirm"; }
    Alt+Escape       { spawn "skwd" "switch" "cancel"; } // closes the switcher without selecting
    Alt+C            { spawn "skwd" "switch" "close"; } // quits the currently selected program
}
```

</Details>

<Details>
<Summary>Hyprland</Summary>

#### Hyprland (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`)

```conf
exec-once = skwd-daemon
exec-once = skwd bar show

bind = SUPER, SPACE,  exec, skwd launcher toggle
bind = SUPER, B, exec, skwd bar toggle
bind = SUPER, COMMA, exec, skwd settings toggle
bind = SUPER, ESCAPE, exec, skwd power toggle

bind = ALT, TAB, exec, skwd switch open
bind = ALT+SHIFT, TAB, exec, skwd switch prev
bind = ALT, RETURN, exec, skwd switch confirm
bind = ALT, ESCAPE, exec, skwd switch cancel // closes the switcher without selecting
bind = ALT, C, exec, skwd switch close // quits the currently selected program
```

</Details>

These are just starting points - swap the keys for whatever fits your layout. `skwd help` (or just `skwd`) prints every available subcommand.

### Arch Linux

<Details>
<Summary>Arch Linux, CachyOS, EndevourOS, Manjaro, Garuda Linux etc.</Summary>

```sh
# Install Skwd and its dependencies
yay -S skwd-daemon-bin skwd ttf-material-design-icons-extended

# Or build Skwd-daemon from source instead:
# yay -S skwd-daemon skwd ttf-material-design-icons-extended

# Enable Skwd-daemon
systemctl --user enable --now skwd-daemon.service

# Note that on some setups you will need to execute skwd-daemon on startup
# Here are some examples:

#   # Niri (~/.config/niri/config.kdl)
#   spawn-at-startup "skwd-daemon"
#
#   # Hyprland (~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf)
#   exec-once = skwd-daemon

# Launch a Skwd widget, like Skwd-bar. Bind this command to a key in your compositor for quick access:
skwd bar toggle
```

If you're updating Skwd-wall, note that Skwd-wall is two applications - Skwd-wall and Skwd-daemon.
Skwd-daemon is automatically installed as part of installing Skwd-wall, but if you're updating and not updating all packages you need to
either use `yay -S skwd-wall --devel` or `yay -S skwd-wall skwd-daemon` 

> **Note:** `yay` is an AUR helper. If you don't have it, install it or use another helper like `paru`.

## Compositor-specific tweaks (KDE Plasma, Hyprland etc)

### Hyprland
<Details>
<Summary>Hyprland fixes and tweaks</Summary>
In testing I experienced issues with NixOS + systemctl service autostart on Hyprland.

This was resolved by adding a basic exec once to `hyprland.conf`, e.g.
  
`exec-once = systemctl --user start skwd-daemon`

</Details>
